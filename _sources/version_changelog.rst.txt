Version Changelog
=================

Version 1.2.0 (released 4/29/2021)
----------------------------------

In table definition entries, "aggregation_style" and "aggregation_method" are
now "aggregate" (boolean) and "aggregation_method".
    - see Transforming Table Definitions -> :ref:`table-def-transformations-add-entry`

Two tranformation methods for adding and editing table def entries have been merged into one.
    - see Transforming Table Definitions -> :ref:`table-def-transformations-add-entry`

In the API concept detail view, "entry_id" query parameter was changed to "cohort_def_entry_id".
    - see API endpoint :ref:`api-concepts-detail-get`

Boolean cohort_def forms now works exactly like category cohort_def forms (except no exclude_selected option).
    - return categories are "True", "False", and null.

Cohort def statistics for dates, numbers: "histogram_data_string" was changed to "histogram_data" and is now a JSON data structure instead of a JSON string.

A lot of method renaming and reorganizing of CohortDefProcessor and DisplayProcessor. If you have any custom ones, you'll want to review the abstract methods and check everything.
    - see classes :ref:`cohort-def-processor-abstract` and :ref:`display-processor-abstract`
