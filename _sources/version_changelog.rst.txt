Version Changelog
=================

Version 2.1.3 (released 12/13/2021)
-----------------------------------

1. Updated to work with Pymongo v4

2. Some endpoints didn't allow you to pass a cohort_def/table_def, instead automatically using
the latest snapshot. Now all should work the same - you can either pass the definition or the
latest snapshot will be assumed.

Version 2.1.0 (released 11/15/2021)
----------------------------------

1. Some minor changes to the database schema. Django migrations will need to be run.

2. Minor changes to cohort def:

- All criteria sets in an extended cohort def now have a criteria_set_name that uniquely identifies the criteria set.
- The criteria_set_name is either auto-generated or comes from the criteria set alias (also new)
- The criteria set alias can be set using the new cohort def transformation option set_criteria_set_alias. This is an optional feature.
- Criteria set with a date rule used to have an event_id with a unique name like "EVENT 1". That has been removed, use the criteria_set_name instead.

3. Major changes to table def:

- most changes affect the table def options for the concept endpoint: /api/concepts/lab_event_name/?include_table_def_options=true
- Some options for aggregation now have additional inputs for customization of that option.
- During an add_entry transformation to the table def, can provide "entry_alias" to give user a way to create their own column headers.
- For cohort def with multiple criteria sets for the same collection, typically data matching any of them will be included when calculating aggregation value. With new option "aggregation_criteria_set" can specify a specific criteria set to limit results.


Version 2.0.0 (released 10/21/2021)
----------------------------------

1. Major overhaul of the query engine. Instead of generating the full report in MongoDB, pulls the
data it needs from MongoDB and does most of the report generation in Python.

Version 1.3.0 (released 6/18/2021)
----------------------------------

1. There is a new model Project, and Reports can have a project associated with them. Projects
at this point are only used to help group reports.

2. Along with the new model Project is a new set of API endpoints.

- see API Endpoints -> :ref:`api-endpoints-projects`

3. There is a new model ContentFlag that allows users to "star" reports that they are interested
in. There is a new API endpoint for flagging reports.

- see API Endpoints -> :ref:`api-endpoints-reports-flag`

4. There is a small Django project with some dummy data for manual testing.




Version 1.2.0 (released 4/29/2021)
----------------------------------

1. In table definition entries, "aggregation_style" and "aggregation_method" are now "aggregate"
(boolean) and "aggregation_method".

- see Transforming Table Definitions -> :ref:`table-def-transformations-add-entry`

2. Two tranformation methods for adding and editing table def entries have been merged into one.

- see Transforming Table Definitions -> :ref:`table-def-transformations-add-entry`

3. In the API concept detail view, "entry_id" query parameter was changed to "cohort_def_entry_id".

- see API endpoint :ref:`api-concepts-detail-get`

4. Boolean cohort_def forms now works exactly like category cohort_def forms (except no exclude_selected option).

- return categories are "True", "False", and null.

5. Cohort def statistics for dates, numbers: "histogram_data_string" was changed to "histogram_data"
and is now a JSON data structure instead of a JSON string.

6. A lot of method renaming and reorganizing of CohortDefProcessor and DisplayProcessor. If you have
any custom ones, you'll want to review the abstract methods and check everything.

- see classes :ref:`cohort-def-processor-abstract` and :ref:`display-processor-abstract`
