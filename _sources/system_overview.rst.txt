Code Architecture
-----------------

Chiron is a Django app. It can be embedded in a larger Django project or set up as a standalone
system in a dedicated Django project.

Chiron can be customized from outside the app code in a wide variety of ways. 
You should avoid editing the Chiron code directly, as this makes it difficult to update as new versions are released.
Configuration can be done using the Django settings.py file, 
by editing the Chiron data dictionary in the database, and by providing custom code
somewhere outside of the Chiron app. It's recommended to create a chiron_config package
in your Django project folder for storing all your custom code related to Chiron.

Database Architecture
---------------------

Django requires a relational database, with a wide variety of systems supported. The relational database
is used to store Django system tables. Chiron also uses the relational database to store the chiron data dictionary, 
user info, and user-created content.

Chiron stores all patient data in a MongoDB database. Even if your patient data is already
in Django models, it must first be pulled into MongoDB before Chiron can present it to the user.

Django does not have any built-in
support for MongoDB, so Chiron uses the pymongo library for connecting to MongoDB.
The Chiron app handles populating and querying the MongoDB database, 
and you do not need to know much about MongoDB to get started.

The Data Dictionary
-------------------

The Chiron data dictionary is a set of Django models containing metadata about your patient data.
Most of the customization of Chiron is controlled by the data dictionary. It defines how your
MongoDB database will be structured, how the data will be pulled into MongoDB during the ETL
process, how queries work, and how the data will be presented to users through the user interface.

Note that the data dictionary is metadata about your patient data - 
not the patient data itself - and is stored in a standard relational database using the Django ORM. 


How the data dictionary relates to the MongoDB Structure
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Your MongoDB structure is affected by the Root and Concept models in your data dictionary:

The **Root model** contains a list of all the data collections you will have in your MongoDB database.
You will have one and only one project root in your Root model, which is typically a patient
or research subject. Then you can have any number of additional roots representing subcollections
that are 1:many with your project root. 

The **Concept model** contains a list of all fields you have data for. Typically, fields will be 
associated with the Root that they are 1:1 with. So for example, concepts like gender and DOB should
be associated with your Patient root. If patients have multiple visits, you'd want to create a
Visit root for concepts like visit date, visit location, visit reason, etc.

As an example, consider a system to keep track of patients visiting your clinic. Patients can visit
any number of times, and they can also have any number of lab tests run. You could define three
Root records:

* Patient root (set as project root)
* Visit root
* Lab test root

This would correspond to a relational structure as follows:

In MongoDB, all of the data is stored in a single collection of documents. Each document would 
represent a patient since that is the project root. Then if that patient had any visits or lab tests, 
those would be embedded in the patient document as a subcollection. 
::
	# the patient collection
	[
		{
		    _id : 123,
		    gender: "female",
		    DOB: "1977-05-12"
		    ...
		    visit_docs : [
		        {_id: 1, location: "Barret Center", ...},
		        ...
		    ],
		    labtest_docs : [
		        {_id: 1, lab_name: "blood glucose", ...},
		        ...
		    ]
		},
		...
	]
	
How the data dictionary relates to the ETL Process
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Chiron has a management command ``chiron_run_etl`` that will automatically pull source data into
MongoDB based on the rules defined in the data dictionary. The ETL process is affected by the 
following data dictionary models:

We've already discussed the **Root** and **Concept** models.

The **SouceCollection model** contains a list of datasets to load into Chiron. A source 
collection can be any Python iterable of the root it's associated with. For example, a source 
collection on root "patients" could simply be a Django queryset based on a Patient model. Or it could
be a CSV file with one line per patient. A source collection on root "surveys" could be 
any iterable that returns one survey at a time. If your data source doesn't match neatly to an
iterable, you will need to create a custom iterable function or class for it.

There are two processor classes that are relevant to the ETL process.
