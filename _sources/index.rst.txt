Welcome to Chiron's documentation!
==================================

Chiron is a data exploration/reporting tool for research data with a strong focus on
human-subject/patient data and longitudinal data. It has a built-in web interface that can be used directly, or an API for integrating Chiron features into existing applications.

Things Chiron can do:
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- import and merge data from multiple sources
- during import, reorganize and modify data or create calculated fields
- users can browse merged data as a single, integrated dataset
- users can define cohorts and get cohort counts
- users can build a report of data that can be saved, shared, or exported to a file
- detailed access control over which patients and data each user is allowed to view


Things Chiron CANNOT do:
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- Chiron does not work on live data. It takes periodic (nightly, weekly, etc.) snapshots from the data source(s).
- Chiron is not a data collection tool. All data is read-only after being imported.

EHR dataset.
