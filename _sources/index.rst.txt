Welcome to Chiron's documentation!
==================================

Chiron is a web application for patient or research-subject data. It can be configured to
consume and merge data from multiple sources. It gives a lot of control over how the data is
organized and presented to the user - including calculated fields and permission settings for
restricting what patients and fields a user can see.

Chiron has an interface for browsing the entire data collection. Users can also build ad-hoc 
queries to identify specific patient cohorts and build/share reports based on those cohorts.
The query system has good support for longitudinal data.
