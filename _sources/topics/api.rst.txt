Chiron API
==========

Chiron has a built-in web interface you can use. However, all of the functionality of Chiron is available
as a web API if you want to integrate it into your own site.

.. _djangorestframework: https://www.django-rest-framework.org/

Chiron uses `djangorestframework`_ for the API. On your development site, you can browse the API
directly:

1. Start your Django server using ``python manage.py runserver``

2. Navigate to the API root. Depending on how your URLs are set up, this will probably either be
   ``http://localhost:8000/api`` or ``http://localhost:8000/chiron/api``.
