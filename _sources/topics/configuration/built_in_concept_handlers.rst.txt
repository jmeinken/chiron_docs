Built-In Concept Handlers
=========================

There are three types of processors associated with a concept - ELT, CohortDef, and Display.
There can also be alternative CohortDef and Display processors for a concept that provide
deidentifed access to the data. And processors take various arguments to allow customization as
well.

Because of all the complexity around processors for concepts, we create logical bundles of
processors in a single class called a ConceptHandler. The Concept handler is a light wrapper
around the different processors for a concept. It provides an abstraction layer that makes it
simpler to change the behavior or data type of a concept in the data dictionary.


Dictionary Concept Handlers
---------------------------

Dictionary concept handlers will work with sources that return records as
Python dictionaries.

Django Concept Handlers
-----------------------

Django concept handlers will work with sources that return records as a
Django queryset.
