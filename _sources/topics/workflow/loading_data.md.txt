# 3. Load data into MongoDB

Once the data dictionary is set up, you can load data anytime with the following command:

```
python manage.py chiron_run_etl
```

This command fully erases the existing data and reloads everything from scratch.

**Partial Loading**

SourceCollections have an exclude_from_etl option. Set to True for the source collections you wish to skip and then run `chiron_run_etl` as usual. Any fields those SourceCollections load into will show as having no data.

You can also load data from a single SourceCollection, but it doesn't always work correctly, so it's not recommended for production.

```
# good for a quick test, but not recommended for production systems
python manage.py chiron_run_etl --source=my_source_collection_id
```
