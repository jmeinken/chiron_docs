# 3. Load data into MongoDB



Once the data dictionary is set up, you can load data from your sources into MongoDB anytime. The process
is guided by the SourceCollection model, and sources will be loaded in order according to `SourceCollection.execution_order`.

The MongoDB connection is defined in your Django settings. The database name for each dataset
is defined in your Dataset table.

```
python manage.py chiron_run_etl
```

This command fully erases the existing data and reloads everything from scratch. If your system has 
multiple datasets you will be prompted to select one.

**Partial Loading**

SourceCollections have an exclude_from_etl option. Set to True for the source collections you wish to skip and then run `chiron_run_etl` as usual. Any fields those SourceCollections load into will show as having no data.

You can also load data from a single SourceCollection, but it doesn't always work correctly, so it's not recommended for production.

```
# good for a quick test, but not recommended for production systems
python manage.py chiron_run_etl --source=my_source_collection_id
```
